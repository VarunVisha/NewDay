# NewDay
This is a ReadME file for NewDay Data Engineer Homework.

A requirement text file has been placed with the application version number for easy usage. 
We run the main.py file and we call in the function from the my_app.py. 

For Task 1- I have read the two files (movies.dat and ratings.dat) into the spark dataframes successfully.
For Task 2- I have created 3 new columns one for max rating, minimum rating, and an average rating as per the users. 
For Task 3- I have created a new dataframe which contains the top 3 movies for each user. Here we have additionally queried using
            the epoch time (we have converted them to human-readable format) and have tried to query the latest as per the time. 
For task 4- I have used Parquet file type for efficient extraction of data this is mainly because it is more columnar and compressed
            when compared to CSV files. Also, its ease to read and write and query execution. 

Thank You!
